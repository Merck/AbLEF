# AbLEF: Antibody Langauge Ensemble Fusion

fuses antibody structural ensemble and language representation for property prediction

current models include:
- language -- AbLang, ProtBERT, ProtBERT-BFD
- multi-structure ensemble -- LEF (CNN transformer)

## requirements
- [git lfs](https://git-lfs.com/) (for locally stored language models)
    - [protbert](https://huggingface.co/Rostlab/protbert) requires local installation to 'config/'
    - [protbert-bfd](https://huggingface.co/Rostlab/protbert-bfd) requires local installation to 'config/' 
    - [ablang](https://github.com/oxpig/AbLang) is locally installed with .yaml file
```
	conda env create conda env create --name ablef --file alef.yaml
```

## preprocess data
### 1. ensemble generation
- Boltzmann imitator for multi-structure ensemble generation saved as pdb files (LowModeMD, MD, metadynamics, replica-exchange, etc.)
- AbLEF manuscript uses LowModeMD in MOE and requires a license that can be acquired from [CCG](https://www.chemcomp.com/)
	- input sequence fasta file with variable fragment (Fv) into MOE
 	- homology model by running MOE Antibody Modeler Application (default settings)
  	- run MOE Stochastic Titration Application (nconf=50, T=300 or 400K, salt_conc=0.1) 
- We also provide an open-source alternative to researchers using ImmuneBuilder and OpenMM
	- input heavy (--h) and light (--l) chain sequence to generate mAb with [immunebuilder](https://github.com/oxpig/ImmuneBuilder)
 	- run [OpenMM simulation engine](https://github.com/openmm/openmm) to generate ensemble with implicit solvent
```
    python ./data/ensemble.py --pdb='/pathway/to/input/mAb.pdb' --output='openmm_step_mAb.pdb' --T=300 --conc=0.1 --steps=50000
```
### 2. cluster structures from ensemble
- pdb files from ensemble generation can be clustered using density based spatial clustering on the backbone atom distance matrices
```
    python ./cluster/main.py input='/pathway/to/pdbs/' output='/pathway/to/pdbs/results' cpu_threads=28 noh=true method=dbscan eps=1.9 min_samples=1 
```
### 3. data storage & processing 
- to utilize multi-structure ensemble fusion (LEF) pdb files in data directories are converted to pairwise distance tensors and saved as numpy arrays
- fasta files are converted to txt files for the heavy and light chain using IMGT canonical alignment (padded as zeros)
- gif below depicts an ensemble of pairwise distance tensors used for training AbLEF
```
    python ./data/preprocess.py
```

## train and hyperparameter tune
- training and tuning execution is specified by the configuration files: 'config/setup.json'
- ensemble length (i.e., L or ens_L) is specified during training and inference: setup['training']['ens_L']
```
    python ./src/train_tune.py
```

### hyperparameter tune
- setup["training"]["ray_tune"] == True
- specify hyperparameter search space in the '__main__' of ./src/train_tune.py
- ray cluster must be initialized before hyperparameter tuning execution
- submit PBS script with specified num_cpus and num_gpus
- start ray cluster
```
    ray start --head --num-cpus=8 --num-gpus=4 --temp-dir="/absolute/path/to/temporary/storage/"
    python ./src/train_tune.py
```

### inference and holdout
- test trained/validated models on holdout by specifying config/setup.json
- AbLEF models trained on hicrt and tagg are located in models/weights
- setup['holdout']['model_path']
- setup['holdout']['holdout_data_path]
```
    python ./src/holdout.py
```

### logging information and model storage
- train_tune.log files are recorded and saved for every time stamped batch run
- runs are also recorded on tensorboard
- ***** = unqiue file identifier (e.g., time stamp or number)
```
    logs/batch_*****/train_tune.log
    logs/batch_*****/events.out.tfevents.***** (setup["training"]["ray_tune"] == False)
    logs/batch_*****/ray_tune/hp_tune_*****/checkpoint_*****/events.out.tfevents.***** (setup["training"]["ray_tune"] == True)
```

- hyperparameter tune runs are implemented by ray tune and models are stored
- non-hyperparameter tuned models are also stored
```
    logs/batch_*****/ray_tune/hp_tune_*****/checkpoint_*****/dict_checkpoint.pkl (setup["training"]["ray_tune"] == True)
    models/weights/batch_*****/ALEF*****.pth (setup["training"]["ray_tune"] == False)
```
## AbPROP integration

	journal = {ICML Workshop on Computational Biology},
	author = {Widatalla, Talal and Rollins, Zachary A and Chen, Ming-Tang and Waight, Andrew and Cheng, Alan},

	month = jul,
	year = {2023}}
```

- we also integrated codebase from AbPROP: https://github.com/merck/abprop 
- AbPROP methods are used as baselines to compare the AbLEF results with graph neural netowrks + language fusion
- graph neural networks are currently only single-structure molecular representations
- to utilize graph neural networks pdb files are converted and saved as torch geometric Data objects for GVP & GAT
```
    python ./data/preprocess_graphs/graph_structs.py
```
